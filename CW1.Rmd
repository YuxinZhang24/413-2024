#It is beneficial to construct a function to perform the task. Because it can process or generate output values while reducing code duplication. This also makes the code easier to understand.

#2
```{r}
calculate_z_score <- function(observed, mean, std_dev) {
  z_score <- (observed - mean) / std_dev
  cat("Z-Score:", z_score, "\n")
}
calculate_z_score(25.77, 23.54, 2.442)

```

#3
```{r}
number_value <- 32
prime_number_value <- 11
result <- (log(number_value) * log10(number_value)) / (prime_number_value^(1/3))
rounded_result <- round(result, 1)
cat("Result:", rounded_result, "\n")

```
